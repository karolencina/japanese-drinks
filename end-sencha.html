        You got Sencha! The abundance of sunlight during the cultivation
        of sencha results in rapid growth, increased vitamin C, as well as a high level of tannin
        which gives sencha its characteristic sharp flavor. A key difference between sencha (and Japanese green tea in general)
        and other teas is that Japanese tea leaves are steamed after being harvested. The steaming process lasts for about 20 seconds,
        and is performed within 20 hours after the leaves are picked. Thanks to this steaming process,
        most of the leaves' green color, fragrance and nutritional components are retained.
